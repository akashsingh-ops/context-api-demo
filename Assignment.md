# Context API React App Assignment

## Objective:

The goal of this assignment is to create a React application using the Context API, write Cypress test cases for the application, and then intentionally introduce errors in the code to make those test cases fail. The user's task is to identify and correct these errors.

### Instructions:

1. **Set Up the Project:**

   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Install dependencies using `npm install`.

2. **Create a React App:**

   - Use Create React App (CRA) as a boilerplate for your React application.
   - Implement a small React app that demonstrates the use of the Context API.
   - Create a context file (e.g., `Context.js`) and a component (e.g., `ExampleComponent.js`) that utilizes this context.

3. **Write Cypress Test Cases:**

   - Install Cypress using `npm install cypress --save-dev`.
   - Write test cases in the `cypress/integration` folder that check the functionality of the React app.
   - Ensure you cover the context-related functionality in your tests.

4. **Copy Code to Boilerplate Folder:**

   - Create a new folder named `boilerplate` in the root of the project.
   - Copy the entire source code of your React app into the `boilerplate` folder.

5. **Intentionally Break the Code:**

   - In the copied code within the `boilerplate` folder, intentionally remove or modify the parts related to the "Context API" concept. This should make your previously written Cypress test cases fail.

6. **Write Assignment Text in Markdown:**

   - Open this `Assignment.md` file.
   - Provide clear instructions on the steps users should take to identify and fix the failing test cases in the modified code.
   - Encourage users to refer to the original code in the main project folder to understand the correct implementation.

7. **Commit Changes:**

   - Commit the changes in the `boilerplate` folder to the main branch.

8. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Push your changes to the remote repository.
